            <p>TempShot is the simple solution to manage your temporary photos. Your camera roll should be free of junk photos like grocery lists, school boards, and homework assignments. Take your picture, set a lifetime for the picture, and TempShot saves the photo to its own gallery, separate from your phoneâ€™s camera roll. When the lifetime expires on the photo, TempShot automatically deletes the photo for you. Streamlined and optimized so you can take your picture in seconds, use it, and forget about it. </p>
