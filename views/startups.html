            <h5>Eden</h5>
            <p>Working in the clinics, Jason Chang has seen patients come back time after time again with the exact same afflictions (persistent allergy, irresistible addictions, chronic diseases). This is when he realized that doctors can only do so much because many times the hardest battles are fought outside of the clinic. Despite the importance of social support beyond the clinical setting, there is lack of such services that can provide quality information and connect you with people who truly understand what you are going through.
Eden is a social support network for people with similar chronic afflictions to be able to connect with one another, share their experiences, ask questions, and find quality answers that are moderated by health professionals. Through forming these communities, people can obtain quality support when they need it the most. Learn more about them at http://edenos.com/

            <h5>Squirrel</h5>
            <p>Have you ever met a group of people, then slowly had to ask for each person’s contact information? You may even write where you met them next to their name or spend even more time finding them on other forms of social media. Next time you meet them you forget their name and end up going through and entire conversation without using it. That is why we created Squirrel. Squirrel minimizes the hassle of rapidly meeting many people in a short period of time and helps to share contact information in a quick and simple way.</p>
